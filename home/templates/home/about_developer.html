        <p>Hello! My name is Sobhan Mokhtari. I am a student from Isfahan, studying at Shahid Ejei 1 School in the 10th grade. I started my journey with Python almost four years ago.
        It has been a long journey. First, I began learning the basics of Python and its syntax. I spent a lot of energy and time on this part.
        After that, I started studying the basic tools of data science and machine learning.</p><br>

        <p>First, I learned NumPy â€” a powerful and fundamental tool for performing large numerical calculations in a very short time.
        I also learned a little about Pandas and working with tabular data as an introduction to the world of machine learning.
        After that, I worked a lot with Scikit-learn, which helped me become stronger and more familiar with classical machine learning.</p><br>

        <p>When I felt that traditional machine learning was not enough, I started learning about deep learning and neural networks.
        I chose PyTorch for this important task. PyTorch is very powerful and offers many options for deep learning, training, optimization, and neural network implementation.
        It is also lower-level compared to TensorFlow, which allows programmers to customize their projects more. Because of this, I chose PyTorch.</p><br>

        <p>My most important references are:</p>
        <a href="https://www.studiebijdehand.nl/p/9781098125974/hands-on-machine-learning-3rd-edition?srsltid=AfmBOorFPduXMnD15_GbgT7hEvIjeOmhGVAt47LGxEq_xLLIvTVr4LvqMl0">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</a>
        <p>by O'REILLY, and</p>
        <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch">Deep Learning with PyTorch</a>
        <p>by Manning.</p><br>

        <p>From these books, I learned the basics and theories of machine learning, some of the mathematics and equations behind optimization and SGD,
        data visualization, model evaluation, the fundamentals of deep learning, and how to implement models with PyTorch.</p><br>

        <p>This became my gateway into the world of computer vision! I started with a very simple image classification project, fine-tuning ResNet-50 and EfficientNet
        on my dataset for plant classification. Although this was a simple project in deep learning, it was really difficult for me to understand the details and code at first.
        I needed a GPU and CUDA for more powerful computation, so I used Google Colab for all of my projects.</p><br>

        <p>Eventually, I decided to take on a bigger and more advanced model in computer vision and histopathology: HoVerNet.
        This was very challenging because HoVerNet is highly complex and includes many custom theories and algorithms.
        For this, I had to code many things myself: a ground-truth generation system, a loss calculation system, the model and its details (matching the official code as closely as possible),
        and a post-processing step to combine model outputs into a suitable output mask. These tasks required a deep understanding of the mechanics and algorithms of HoVerNet.</p><br>

        <p>I wanted a model for instance segmentation in histopathological microscopic H&E images.
        Because of this, I chose HoVerNet, which is designed specifically for nucleus segmentation and classification.</p><br>

        <p>In conclusion, this is my latest project, and I have tried to create a strong computer vision project with the knowledge I have gained.
        I hope you enjoyed reading about my journey in programming and machine learning. :)</p>
